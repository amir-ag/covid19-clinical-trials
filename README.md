This 3 week project should help matching probands and recruiting clinical trials related to covid-19. A beta version is currently deployed here: https://clinical-trials.propulsion-learn.ch/ 

Frontend: displays a map with clusters of markers indicating the location of clinical trials sites

Backend: Updates itself once per day (gets new studies, gets coordinates of those sites and saves them to the database)
